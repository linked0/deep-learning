    "ResNet significantly changed the view of how to parametrize the functions in deep networks. DenseNet is to some extent the logical extension of this. To understand how to arrive at it, let's take a small detour to theory. Recall the Taylor expansion for functions. For scalars it can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = f(0) + f'(x) x + \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) x^2 + \\frac{1}{6} f'''(x) x^3 + o(x^3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that it decomposes the function into increasingly higher order terms. In a similar vein, ResNet decomposes functions into \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x} + g(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, ResNet decomposes $f$ into a simple linear term and a more complex nonlinear one. What if we want to go beyond two terms? A solution was proposed by [Huang et al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) in the form of DenseNet, an architecture that reported record performance on the ImageNet dataset. \n",

    "The key difference between ResNet and DenseNet is that in the latter case outputs are *concatenated* rather than added. As a result we perform a mapping from $\\mathbf{x}$ to its values after applying an increasingly complex sequence of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} \\to \\left[\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x})), f_3(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x})), \\ldots\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, all these functions are combined in an MLP to reduce the number of features again. In terms of implementation this is quite simple - rather than adding terms, we concatenate them. The name DenseNet arises from the fact that the dependency graph between variables becomes quite dense. The last layer of such a chain is densely connected to all previous layers. The main components that compose a DenseNet are dense blocks and transition layers. The former defines how the inputs and outputs are concatenated, while the latter controls the number of channels so that it is not too large.\n",

    "* In terms of cross-layer connections, unlike ResNet, where inputs and outputs are added together, DenseNet concatenates inputs and outputs on the channel dimension.\n",
    "* The main units that compose DenseNet are dense blocks and transition layers.\n",
    "* We need to keep the dimensionality under control when composing the network by adding transition layers that shrink the number of channels again. \n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do we use average pooling rather than max-pooling in the transition layer? \n",
    "1. One of the advantages mentioned in the DenseNet paper is that its model parameters are smaller than those of ResNet. Why is this the case?\n",
    "1. One problem for which DenseNet has been criticized is its high memory consumption. \n",
    "    * Is this really the case? Try to change the input shape to $224\\times 224$ to see the actual (GPU) memory consumption.\n",
    "    * Can you think of an alternative means of reducing the memory consumption? How would you need to change the framework?\n",
    "1. Implement the various DenseNet versions presented in Table 1 of the [DenseNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993).\n",
    "1. Why do we not need to concatenate terms if we are just interested in $\\mathbf{x}$ and $f(\\mathbf{x})$ for ResNet? Why do we need this for more than two layers in DenseNet?\n",
    "1. Design a DenseNet for fully connected networks and apply it to the Housing Price prediction task. \n",
