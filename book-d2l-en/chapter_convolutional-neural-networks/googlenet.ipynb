    "# Networks with Parallel Concatenations (GoogLeNet)\n",
    "\n",
    "During the ImageNet Challenge in 2014, a new architecture emerged that outperformed the rest. [Szegedy et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) proposed a structure that combined the strengths of the NiN and repeated blocks paradigms. At its heart was the rather pragmatic answer to the question as to which size of convolution is ideal for processing. After all, we have a smorgasbord of choices, $1 \\times 1$ or $3 \\times 3$, $5 \\times 5$ or even larger. And it isn't always clear which one is the best. As it turns out, the answer is that a combination of all the above works best. Over the next few years, researchers made several improvements to GoogLeNet. In this section, we will introduce the first version of this model series in a slightly simplified form - we omit the peculiarities that were added to stabilize training, due to the availability of better training algorithms. \n",

    "## Inception Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic convolutional block in GoogLeNet is called an Inception block, named after the movie of the same name. This basic block is more complex in structure than the NiN block described in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Structure of the Inception block. ](../img/inception.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the figure above, there are four parallel paths in the Inception block. The first three paths use convolutional layers with window sizes of $1\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$, and $5\\times 5$ to extract information from different spatial sizes. The middle two paths will perform a $1\\times 1$ convolution on the input to reduce the number of input channels, so as to reduce the model's complexity. The fourth path uses the $3\\times 3$ maximum pooling layer, followed by the $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer, to change the number of channels. The four paths all use appropriate padding to give the input and output the same height and width. Finally, we concatenate the output of each path on the channel dimension and input it to the next layer. The customizable parameters of the Inception block are the number of output channels per layer, which can be used to control the model complexity."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Inception block is equivalent to a subnetwork with four paths. It extracts information in parallel through convolutional layers of different window shapes and maximum pooling layers. $1 \\times 1$ convolutions reduce channel dimensionality on a per-pixel level. Max-pooling reduces the resolution.\n",
    "* GoogLeNet connects multiple well-designed Inception blocks with other layers in series. The ratio of the number of channels assigned in the Inception block is obtained through a large number of experiments on the ImageNet data set.\n",
    "* GoogLeNet, as well as its succeeding versions, was one of the most efficient models on ImageNet, providing similar test accuracy with lower computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are several iterations of GoogLeNet. Try to implement and run them. Some of them include the following:\n",
    "    * Add a batch normalization layer, as described later in this chapter [2].\n",
    "    * Make adjustments to the Inception block [3].\n",
    "    * Use \"label smoothing\" for model regularization [3].\n",
    "    * Include it in the residual connection, as described later in this chapter [4].\n",
    "1. What is the minimum image size for GoogLeNet to work?\n",
    "1. Compare the model parameter sizes of AlexNet, VGG, and NiN with GoogLeNet. How do the latter two network architectures significantly reduce the model parameter size?\n",
    "1. Why do we need a large range convolution initially?\n",
