    "# Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we discussed some properties that make language unique. The key is that the number of tokens (aka words) is large and very unevenly distributed. Hence, a naive multiclass classification approach to predict the next symbol doesn't always work very well. Moreover, we need to turn text into a format that we can optimize over, i.e. we need to map it to vectors. At its extreme we have two alternatives. One is to treat each word as a unique entity, as proposed e.g. by [Salton, Wong and Yang, 1975](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361220). The problem with this strategy is that we might well have to deal with 100,000 to 1,000,000 vectors for very large and diverse corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the other extreme lies the strategy to predict one character at a time, as suggested e.g. by [Ling et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02096.pdf). A good balance in between both strategies is [byte-pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), as described by [Sennrich, Haddow and Birch, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909) for the purpose of neural machine translation. It decomposes text into syllable-like fragments that occur frequently. This allows for models that are able to generate words like `heteroscedastic` or `pentagram` based on previously viewed words, e.g. `heterogeneous`, `homoscedastic`, `diagram`, and `pentagon`. Going into details of these models is beyond the scope of the current chapter. We will address this later when discussing [Natural Language Processing](../chapter_natural-language-processing/) in much more detail. Suffice it to say that it can contribute significantly to the accuracy of natural language processing models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity we will limit ourselves to pure character sequences. We use H.G. Wells' *The Timemachine* as before. We begin by filtering the text and convert it into a a sequence of character IDs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin, as before, by loading the data and by mapping it into a sequence of whitespaces, punctuation signs and regular characters. Preprocessing is minimal and we limit ourselves to removing multiple whitespaces."

    "## Training Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we need to read mini-batches of examples and labels at random. Since sequence data is by its very nature sequential, we need to address the issue of processing it. We did so in a rather ad-hoc manner when we introduced [Sequence Models](sequence.md). Let's formalize this a bit. Consider the beginning of the book we just processed. If we want to split it up into sequences of 5 symbols each, we have quite some freedom since we could pick an arbitrary offset. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Different offsets lead to different subsequences when splitting up text.](../img/timemachine-5gram.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, any one of these offsets is fine. Hence, which one should we pick? In fact, all of them are equally good. But if we pick all offsets we end up with rather redundant data due to overlap, particularly if the sequences are long. Picking just a random set of initial positions is no good either since it does not guarantee uniform coverage of the array. For instance, if we pick $n$ elements at random out of a set of $n$ with random replacement, the probability for a particular element not being picked is $(1-1/n)^n \\to e^{-1}$. This means that we cannot expect uniform coverage this way. Even randomly permuting a set of all offsets does not offer good guarantees. Instead we can use a simple trick to get both *coverage* and *randomness*: use a random offset, after which one uses the terms sequentially. We describe how to accomplish this for both random sampling and sequential partitioning strategies below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code randomly generates a minibatch from the data each time. Here, the batch size `batch_size` indicates to the number of examples in each mini-batch and `num_steps` is the length of the sequence (or time steps if we have a time series) included in each example.\n",
    "In random sampling, each example is a sequence arbitrarily captured on the original sequence. The positions of two adjacent random mini-batches on the original sequence are not necessarily adjacent. The target is to predict the next character based on what we've seen so far, hence the labels are the original sequence, shifted by one character. Note that this is not recommended for latent variable models, since we do not have access to the hidden state *prior* to seeing the sequence. We packaged the above code in the `load_data_timemachine` function of the `d2l` package to make it easier to call it in later chapters. It returns four variables: `corpus_indices`, `char_to_idx`, `idx_to_char`, and `vocab_size`."
