    "One-hot encoding vectors provide an easy way to express words as vectors in order to process them in a deep network. In a nutshell, we map each word to a different unit vector: assume that the number of different characters in the dictionary is $N$ (the `vocab_size`) and each character has a one-to-one correspondence with a single value in the index of successive integers from 0 to $N-1$. If the index of a character is the integer $i$, then we create a vector $\\mathbf{e}_i$ of all 0s with a length of $N$ and set the element at position $i$ to 1. This vector is the one-hot vector of the original character. The one-hot vectors with indices 0 and 2 are shown below (the length of the vector is equal to the dictionary size)."

If the largest eigenvalue of the matrices is typically larger than $1$, then the product of many such matrices can be much larger than $1$. As a result, the aggregate gradient might explode.

Example 2 is considerably worse by producing a nonsensical and borderline dysgrammatical extension. Nonetheless, at least the model has learned how to spell words and some degree of correlation between words. Lastly, example 3 indicates a poorly trained model that doesn't fit data. \n",

    "One way of measuring the quality of the model is to compute $p(w)$, i.e. the likelihood of the sequence. Unfortunately this is a number that is hard to understand and difficult to compare. After all, shorter sequences are *much* more likely than long ones, hence evaluating the model on Tolstoy's magnum opus ['War and Peace'](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm) will inevitably produce a much smaller likelihood than, say, on Saint-Exupery's novella ['The Little Prince'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince).

A lower bound on the number of bits is given by $-\\log_2 p(w_t|w_{t-1}, \\ldots w_1)$. A good language model should allow us to predict the next word quite accurately and thus it should allow us to spend very few bits on compressing the sequence.

In particular, we will see how training using the 'separate' and 'sequential' term generation will affect the performance of the model."

    "* Sequence models need state initialization for training.\n",
    "* Between sequential models you need to ensure to detach the gradient, to ensure that the automatic differentiation does not propagate effects beyond the current sample.\n",
    "* A simple RNN language model consists of an encoder, an RNN model and a decoder. \n",
    "* Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion (but it cannot fix vanishing gradients).\n",
    "* Perplexity calibrates model performance across variable sequence length. It is the exponentiated average of the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* Sequential partitioning typically leads to better models. \n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that one-hot encoding is equivalent to picking a different embedding for each object.\n",
    "1. Adjust the hyperparameters to improve the perplexity. \n",
    "    * How low can you go? Adjust embeddings, hidden units, learning rate, etc.\n",
    "    * How well will it work on other books by H. G. Wells, e.g. [The War of the Worlds](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36).\n",
    "1. Run the code in this section without clipping the gradient. What happens?\n",
    "1. Set the `pred_period` variable to 1 to observe how the under-trained model (high perplexity) writes lyrics. What can you learn from this?\n",
    "1. Change adjacent sampling so that it does not separate hidden states from the computational graph. Does the running time change? How about the accuracy?\n",
    "1. Replace the activation function used in this section with ReLU and repeat the experiments in this section.\n",
    "1. Prove that the perplexity is the inverse of the harmonic mean of the conditional word probabilities. \n",
