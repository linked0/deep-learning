    "# Batch Normalization - Solutions\n",
    "Batch normalization is most useful when building deep neural networks. To demostrate this, we'll create a convolutional neural network with 20 convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layer. We'll use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataet, which should be familiar to you by now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thhis is **not** a good network for classifying MNIST digits. You could create a muchh simpler network and get better results. However, to give you hands-on experience with batch normalization, we had to make an example that was:\n",
    "1. Complicated enough that training would benefit from batch normalization.\n",
    "2. Simple enough that it would train quickly, since this is meant to be a short exercise just to give you some practice adding batch normalization.\n",
    "3. Simple enough that the architecuture would be easy to understand without additional resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes two versions of the network that you can edit. This first uses higher level funtions from the tf.layers package. The second is the same network, but uses only lower level functionsin the tf.nn package.\n",
    "1. Batch Normalization with tf.layers.batch_normalization\n",
    "2. Batch Normalization with tf.nn.batch_normalization\n",

    "This following cell loads Tensorflow, downloads the MNIST dataset if necessary, and loads it into an object named mnist. You'll need to run this cell before running anything else in the notebook."
